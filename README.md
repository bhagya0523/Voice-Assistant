A Python voice assistant is a software application written in the Python programming language that 
utilizes speech recognition and synthesis to enable users to interact with it through spoken language. It 
converts spoken words into text, processes user commands, and responds by converting text into spoken 
words. Typically, it performs various tasks such as answering questions, providing information, and 
controlling devices based on voice commands. The implementation often involves the use of libraries like 
SpeechRecognition and pyttsx3 for efficient speech recognition and synthesis, respectively.
